A program that allows the user to select a folder of images on their computer, (must be named img0, img1 etc.) and display the first image.
It then uses global shortcuts (atoms) (by default set to Ctrl or Shift + T, Ctrl or Shift + U) to cycle backwards and forwards through the images.
The point is that these shortcuts can be detected by the window even while unfocused, so you don't have to be tabbed in to the window to use it.
